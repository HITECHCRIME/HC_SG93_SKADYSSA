## Notes

Gas masks/containment masks in iceland. Traversing the humanless landscape. 
? -> Slowly more people start to appear along the way. Also with masks.
Song part of the (Iceland)- Northern Incursion.

FREESTYLE. SKADYSSA - STATE OF CALM WITH ONESELF AND OTHERS AROUND YOU. ACHIEVED PREFERABLY IN A COLD CLIMATE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE GROWING ON ME - THE CONCEPT OF CHANT RAP. USING A PROPER MIC WITH A PHONE NOW. @audiotechnica_eu AT2005USB AND @lumatouch FOR RECORDING VIA ADAPTER AND EDITING THE A/V. BACKGROUND STILL FROM A VIDEO BY @sara.mora.hsshsh - CHECK HER STUFF. /// FULL PROTOTYPE SOON ON IGTV.
